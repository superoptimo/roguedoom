This is a failed experiment with [Jules AI assistant]([https://jules.google.com).

I've just asked in the prompt,

> Make a Rogue-Like DOOM that generates 3D procedural worlds randomly, and player could fight against monsters and search for keys for opening the 3 kind of gates: red, yellow and blue to finish the level. This game should implement collision physics. Make this project for web in Javascript with WebGL graphics.

It didn't work.
